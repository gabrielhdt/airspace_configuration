\section{Introduction}
The airspace is divided into sectors, themselves divided into elementary
modules. Each sector is managed by a controller working position composed of two
controllers.
During the day, sectors are split and merged to be able to
manage the varying traffic. Splitting creates smaller sectors and is therefore
used when traffic gets too dense. On the opposite, merging sectors allows fewer
controllers to manage the same airspace, and is therefore used when traffic
becomes sparse.

Currently, configuration is mainly decided on the fly by chief officer (TODO).
This decision is based on the actual workload on each position. This intuitive
approach does not take into account future traffic. This papers aims at
providing a method offering a smoother workload during the day.

Several methods have been considered to solve the dynamic airspace configuration
problem, for instance via genetic algorithms in~\cite{sergeeva2017dynamic},
constraint local search in~\cite{jagare2013constraint}, integer linear
programming in~\cite{treimuth2016branch} or dynamic programming
in~\cite{bloem2010dynamic}.

As seen in~\cite{treimuth2016branch}
or~\cite{sergeeva2017dynamic}, a temporal sequence of configurations will be
provided. Two costs will be considered to create the sequence, namely the cost
associated to each configuration and transition. The former is based on the
workload estimated for one sector given a neural network
(see~\cite{gianazza2010forecasting}).

The sequence of configurations will be represented as a tree. The resulting
sequence will therefore be a path from the root to a leaf of this tree. This
problem is highly combinatorial (partitioning of the airspace). Knowing that a
sochastic tree search algorithm has been honing from a good Go
player~\cite{gelly2012go} to the best one with AlphaGo.
